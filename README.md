# Introduction_CPP

## How to compile: 
g++ -g main.cpp Sorting/sorting.cpp Sorting/bubble.cpp

## Contributing Guidelines

### Format
All code should follow a singular format as all other open source projects to help maintain it better.
I am using Classname / Function name in capital case. e.g class SortingAlgorithm{ ... }
and having camel case for all other variables. e.g int crossEntropy = 0;
If you have any suggestions put them forward.
